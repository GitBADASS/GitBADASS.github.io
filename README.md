It's a simple website used [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) as its templtae. We created it to publish something we learned or studied.

Following the official tutorial of Docusaurus, two branches in this repo have already been prepared for this website. One named [source](https://github.com/GitBADASS/GitBADASS.github.io/tree/source) is used to store the source-code, and the other one named [deployment](https://github.com/GitBADASS/GitBADASS.github.io/tree/deployment) is used to deploy the website, what it contains is the builed result of a [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus)-based project.

## What would be published to publish on this website? 
School subjects: 
- Math, Physics etc. problems with solutions;
- Systemic approaches or theories of Math/Physics;
- Notes of daily studying.

After-school projects: 
- Project docs;
